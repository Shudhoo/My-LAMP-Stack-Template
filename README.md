LAMP Stack AWS Deployment Template

This template provided a LAMP Stack (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) setup on AWS for deploying a PHP-based website with high availability and scalability.
Architecture Overview
EC2 Instance (Ubuntu Linux): Hosts the PHP website with Apache web server.
MySQL (Amazon RDS): A managed relational database for storing application data.
Elastic Load Balancer (ELB): Distributes incoming traffic for high availability.

LAMP Stack AWS Architecture
This architectural diagram illustrates the LAMP Stack deployment on AWS with high availability using the following components:

Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) ‚Äì Distributes traffic across multiple EC2 instances.
Auto Scaling Group (ASG) ‚Äì Automatically scales instances across multiple subnets for fault tolerance.
Amazon EC2 Instances (Ubuntu, Apache, PHP) ‚Äì Hosts the PHP website.
Amazon RDS (MySQL) ‚Äì Manages the relational database securely.
Subnets & VPC ‚Äì Instances are placed in different subnets inside a VPC to ensure high availability.

üí° Security Measures:

ELB Security Group ‚Äì Accepts incoming internet traffic.
EC2 Security Group ‚Äì Accepts traffic only from ELB for security.
RDS Security Group ‚Äì Accepts database connections only from EC2 instances.
üìç Usage:
Use this architecture as a reference for deploying a scalable and secure LAMP Stack on AWS.
